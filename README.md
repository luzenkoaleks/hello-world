# hello-world
this repository is for practising the GitHub Flow
letÂ´s have a first look at how GitHub works!

I want to become a programmer. 
This is the beginning of my new journey.
For that matter I want to first get an idea about how GitHub works, since I heard it is a necessary and helpful tool for programmers.
